## üîÑ Process Overview

### 1. **Trigger Event**
The process begins automatically when an onboarding request email is received at a monitored inbox. AI Prompts parse the email into structured JSON data and store it in SharePoint.

### 2. **Copilot Studio Agent Flow**
- The agent greets the user and initiates the onboarding flow.
- It fetches applicant details from SharePoint.
- Sends a Line Manager approval request, along with a form to specify hardware and application needs.

### 3. **Account & Group Setup (Azure Entra ID)**
- Creates Entra ID account for the new employee.
- Updates department, job title, and phone number.
- Assigns security groups and email distribution groups.

### 4. **US-Specific Processing (Conditional)**
- If the applicant is based in the US, additional approval is required to fetch and update Employee ID on Entra & SharePoint.

### 5. **Hardware & Application Provisioning**
- Sends a summary to IT for provisioning hardware and software.
- Initiates approvals from IT and then from the new joiner to confirm successful onboarding.
