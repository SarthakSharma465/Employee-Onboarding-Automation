- Azure Entra ID account creation  
- Email setup & distribution list management  
- Hardware & application provisioning  
- Multi-step approvals with HR, Line Managers, and IT
- Filling Zendesk Ticket Forms for audit & tracking purposes

These manual processes are often:

## üîÑ Process Overview

### 1. **Trigger Event - Zendesk**
The process begins automatically when an onboarding request ticket is received on Zendesk. AI Prompts parse the ticket information into structured JSON data and store it in SharePoint.

### 2. **Copilot Studio Agent Flow**
- The Onboarding steward greets the agent and initiates the onboarding flow.
- Now the agent fetches the details of the latest new joiner from SharePoint.
- Sends a Line Manager approval request, along with a form to specify hardware and application needs.

### 3. **Account & Group Setup (Azure Entra ID)**
- Creates Entra ID account for the new employee.
- Updates department, job title, and phone number.
- Assigns security groups and email distribution groups.

### 4. **US-Specific Processing (Conditional)**
- If the applicant is based in the US, additional approval is required to fetch and update the Employee ID on Entra & SharePoint.

### 5. **Zendesk Joiner Form Update**
- The agent triggers a Power Automate flow to complete a checklist on the Zendesk Ticket's form for the IT Team to track the progress on the onboarding.

### 6. **Hardware & Application Provisioning**
- Sends a summary to IT for provisioning hardware and software.
- Initiates approvals from IT and then from the new joiner to confirm successful onboarding.

### 7. **New Joiner Notification**
- Sends an email dynamically fetching the user details like the Applicant Name, Department, Role etc. to the organisation to welcome the new joiner.
